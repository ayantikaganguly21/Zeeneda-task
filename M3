Session3
Question 1: What was the objective of Session 3 (Elicitation to Requirements Candidates)?
Answer:
The objective of Session 3 was to transform elicitation outputs such as meeting notes and transcripts into structured, traceable requirements candidates. The session focused on improving the quality of inputs entering analysis by ensuring that candidate requirements are atomic, unambiguous, testable, and linked to clear evidence. Participants learned how to identify and prioritize stakeholders, plan elicitation activities, use AI safely for summarization and extraction, and draft a problem statement and scope boundary. The overall goal was to ensure that requirements candidates are well-structured hypotheses that can later be validated and converted into approved requirements.
Question 2: Why is stakeholder analysis important before elicitation?
Answer:
Stakeholder analysis is important because the quality of elicitation depends on who is involved in the discussion. Different stakeholders provide different perspectives, including business goals, operational constraints, technical limitations, risks, and compliance requirements. By identifying and prioritizing stakeholders using techniques such as the Power–Interest grid, analysts can ensure that high-impact and high-influence voices are engaged early. This reduces rework, prevents late discovery of constraints, and aligns expectations before requirements are formalized. Proper stakeholder analysis minimizes the risk of scope conflicts and missing requirements.
Question 3: How are requirements candidates structured in Session 3?
Answer:
In Session 3, requirements candidates are structured as atomic statements, meaning each candidate contains only one clear idea. Each candidate includes a unique ID, a clear statement, rationale explaining why it is needed, source evidence such as a stakeholder quote or transcript reference, type classification (Functional, Non-Functional, or Constraint), acceptance criteria for verification, and open questions if ambiguity exists. This structured approach ensures traceability, clarity, and readiness for analysis. Candidates are treated as hypotheses that require validation before becoming approved requirements.
Question 4: How was AI used safely in Session 3?
Answer:
AI was used to summarize long transcripts, extract candidate requirements, cluster similar themes, and draft follow-up questions. However, AI outputs were treated as drafts and not as final artifacts. Each extracted candidate was validated by checking traceability to a specific stakeholder statement or transcript line. Sensitive information was redacted before processing, and AI-generated content was clearly labeled. Human validation ensured that no hallucinated or invented facts were included. This approach maintained privacy, accuracy, and professional accountability.
Question 5: What problem statement was drafted for the CityCare Clinic scenario?
Answer:
The problem statement described that CityCare Clinic currently schedules appointments through phone calls and a shared spreadsheet, with reminders handled manually. This results in double-bookings, missed appointments, clinician idle time, and staff inefficiencies. The clinic aims to reduce no-shows and scheduling errors while improving patient experience and operational visibility. Success will be measured through reduced double-bookings, lower no-show rates, improved time-to-book appointments, and better reporting accuracy. Constraints include privacy requirements for messaging, single sign-on integration, monitoring needs, and audit logging requirements.
Question 6: How was scope defined for the CityCare Clinic upgrade?
Answer:
The defined scope included online appointment booking, automated reminder notifications respecting patient preferences, scheduling rule enforcement such as visit-type time gaps, and implementation of audit logging and monitoring. Out-of-scope items included full Electronic Health Record replacement, clinical diagnosis functionality, billing system overhaul, and marketing features. Assumptions included continued use of the existing EHR system and compliance with privacy regulations. Defining in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries ensured clarity, reduced scope creep, and aligned stakeholder expectations before moving to detailed requirements analysis.
